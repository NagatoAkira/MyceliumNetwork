# MyceliumNetwork
"In biological systems, learning and functioning are inseparable. Why should AI be any different?"

🌿 The Vision
The Mycelium Method is a paradigm shift away from "frozen" neural architectures. Traditional Deep Learning (CNNs, Transformers) creates a rigid separation between the training phase and the inference phase. Our goal is to develop a Continuous Growth AI-an organic computational substrate where the architecture isn't engineered by humans but "grown" through environmental interaction.

We are moving towards Non-Modular AI: a seamless, uniform core that doesn't require specific modules for different tasks. Simply plug in new receptors (inputs) or effectors (outputs), and the Mycelium will adapt, proving that "old" neurons carry the foundational features necessary for "new" data.

🧬 Key Architectural Principles
1. Seamless Computational Substrate
Unlike layered models, the Mycelium consists of a fluid pool of 1,800 Autonomous Agents. There are no fixed layers or pre-defined paths. Signal propagation is a result of Resonant Voting, where the collective intelligence of the graph emerges from individual agent expertise.

2. Evolutionary Budding & Culling
Optimization is driven by survival of the fittest, not just backpropagation.

Culling: The bottom-performing agents are periodically removed.

Budding: Elite agents "bud" offspring-mutated copies that inherit the parent's knowledge but explore new feature spaces.

3. Cognitive Core (Memory Freezing)
As the system reaches historical performance peaks, the most successful agents are "frozen" into a Long-Term Memory Core. These "Veterans" provide a stable foundation of knowledge, allowing younger "Plastic" neurons to focus on rare features and edge cases without risking catastrophic forgetting.

4. Spatial Attention (Visionary Jitter)
Each agent possesses an autonomous "eye." Instead of looking at a static input, agents test multiple spatial shifts (up, down, left, right) to find the perfect resonance with a feature. This creates a natural Translation Invariance without the need for complex convolutional layers.

🚀 Performance Snapshot: MNIST Digit Recognition
While standard linear models struggle to break 50-60% without backprop, the Mycelium Method achieves:

Accuracy: ~92% (on sklearn.datasets.load_digits)

Method: Zero-Backprop, Pure Evolutionary Resonance.

Stability: High resistance to overfitting due to Stochastic Noise Injection.

🛠 Technical Methodology
Resonance over Gradients
Instead of calculating errors through chain-rule derivatives, we use Precision-Based Rewards. Agents are rewarded for "Uniqueness"—the ability to correctly identify a pattern when the rest of the system fails.

Shadow Stabilization (EMA)
To handle the "jitter" of evolutionary learning, we maintain Shadow Weights using Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This acts as a "Headquarters" that consolidates the erratic experience of "Scout" neurons into a stable, reliable world model.
